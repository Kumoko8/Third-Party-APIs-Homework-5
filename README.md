# Third-Party-APIs-Homework-5

# Description

This repository is for creating homework #5 for UT Bootcamp to make a scheduler using 3rd party APIs. This project taught me about APIs that come from outside the browser such as dayjs. We also practiced using text areas to receive user input  and local storage to store information in the browser.   

# How to Use
This project has today's date and time slots that are color coded to show past, present, and future hours. Type in an event in the corresponding time slot and click the save button and your schedule will be complete!
